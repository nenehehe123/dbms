-- Step 1: Create Tables
CREATE TABLE Booth (
    Boothid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Location VARCHAR(100),
    BIncharge VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE Voter (
    VoterId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Votername VARCHAR(100),
    Gender VARCHAR(10),
    Boothid INT REFERENCES Booth(Boothid),
    Checkvote INT CHECK (Checkvote IN (0, 1))
);

-- Step 2: Count of voters in each booth
SELECT Boothid, COUNT(*) AS TotalVoters
FROM Voter
GROUP BY Boothid;

-- Step 3: Count of Male voters who voted
SELECT COUNT(*) AS MaleVoted
FROM Voter
WHERE Gender = 'Male' AND Checkvote = 1;

-- Step 4: Total count of voters who voted
SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalVoted
FROM Voter
WHERE Checkvote = 1;

-- Step 5: Booth ID, location and count of voters voted
SELECT B.Boothid, B.Location, COUNT(V.VoterId) AS VotedCount
FROM Booth B
JOIN Voter V ON B.Boothid = V.Boothid
WHERE V.Checkvote = 1
GROUP BY B.Boothid, B.Location;

-- Step 6: Function to return poll percentage in a booth
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION GetPollPercentage(bid INT)
RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$
DECLARE

BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO total FROM Voter WHERE Boothid = bid;

        RETURN 0;
    END IF;
    percentage := (voted * 100.0) / total;
    RETURN percentage;

-- Call Example:
-- SELECT GetPollPercentage(101);
