-- Step 1: Create Passenger Table
CREATE TABLE Passenger (
    PNR_NO SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT,
    Gender CHAR(1),
    TicketNo VARCHAR(20)
);

-- Step 2: Insert Sample Data
INSERT INTO Passenger (Name, Age, Gender, TicketNo) VALUES
('SANDRA', 45, 'F', 'T101'),
('SAMIRA', 52, 'F', 'T102'),
('SURESH', 38, 'M', 'T103'),
('SANTHOSH', 41, 'M', 'T104'),
('ELENA', 60, 'F', 'T105'),
('EDWARD', 55, 'M', 'T106'),
('JOHN', 25, 'M', 'T107');

-- Q1: Display unique PNR_NO of all passengers
SELECT DISTINCT PNR_NO FROM Passenger;

-- Q2: Display all the names of male passengers
SELECT Name FROM Passenger WHERE Gender = 'M';

-- Q3: Display the ticket numbers and names of all the passengers
SELECT TicketNo, Name FROM Passenger;

-- Q4: Find the ticket numbers of the passengers whose name start with ‘S’ and ends with ‘A’
SELECT TicketNo FROM Passenger WHERE Name LIKE 'S%A';

-- Q5: Find the names of Passengers whose age is between 40 and 60
SELECT Name FROM Passenger WHERE Age BETWEEN 40 AND 60;

-- Q6: Display all the passengers names beginning with ‘E’
SELECT Name FROM Passenger WHERE Name LIKE 'E%';

-- Q7: Display the sorted list of Passengers names
SELECT Name FROM Passenger ORDER BY Name ASC;
