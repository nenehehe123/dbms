-- Step 1: Create Tables
CREATE TABLE Dept (
    Deptno INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Dname VARCHAR(100),
    Loc VARCHAR(100),
    DeptmanagerId INT
);

CREATE TABLE Employee (
    EmpId INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Empname VARCHAR(100),
    Sal NUMERIC,
    Deptno INT REFERENCES Dept(Deptno)
);

-- Step 2: Count of Employees & Average Salary per Department
SELECT Deptno, COUNT(*) AS EmpCount, AVG(Sal) AS AvgSalary
FROM Employee
GROUP BY Deptno;

-- Step 3: Employee Name, Department Name, Salary
SELECT E.Empname, D.Dname, E.Sal
FROM Employee E
JOIN Dept D ON E.Deptno = D.Deptno;

-- Step 4: Employee Name and Department Manager Name
SELECT E.Empname AS Employee, M.Empname AS Manager
FROM Employee E
JOIN Dept D ON E.Deptno = D.Deptno
JOIN Employee M ON D.DeptmanagerId = M.EmpId;

-- Step 5: Procedure to Get Salary of Employee by EmpId
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE GetSalary(IN eid INT)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    salary NUMERIC;
BEGIN
    SELECT Sal INTO salary FROM Employee WHERE EmpId = eid;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Salary: %', salary;
END;
$$;

-- Call Example:
-- CALL GetSalary(101);
